# [Enhancement #2 Algorithms & Data Structures](https://github.com/Jeef-K/cs499-Capstone/tree/main/cs499_capstone_algorithms_data_structures_enhanced)


The artifact I am presenting is a course advising program, which I developed during my Data Structures and Algorithms course in Winter 2024. Originally, the program was designed using a Binary Search Tree to store and manage courses. However, as part of my enhancement, I refactored the code to use a Java ArrayList in a sorted manner, demonstrating the flexibility of data structures and the importance of evaluating algorithmic efficiency based on specific needs. This change allowed me to manage the trade-offs involved in choosing between performance and simplicity, highlighting my ability to design computing solutions that are adaptable to various contexts.

I chose to include this artifact in my ePortfolio because it represents my problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking when faced with design trade-offs. The program showcases my ability to balance complexity and performance by selecting the most appropriate data structure for a given problem. The transition from a BST to a sorted ArrayList enabled me to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. While the BST offered better search efficiency for large datasets (O(log n)), the ArrayList allowed for simpler insertion logic and random access (O(1)) while maintaining acceptable performance (O(log n) for searches in a sorted list). This artifact demonstrates my proficiency in designing algorithms and managing trade-offs between ease of use and performance, a crucial aspect of real-world computing solutions.

This artifact highlights my understanding of both tree-based structures and list-based structures. Initially, the BST provided efficient logarithmic search capabilities, showcasing my ability to implement more complex data structures. However, the program's enhancement to use a sorted ArrayList demonstrates my skill in refactoring code to optimize for simplicity when performance constraints are not as critical. This transition illustrates my flexibility in adapting solutions to fit the specific needs of a project while maintaining overall functionality.

The program was improved significantly by transitioning to a sorted ArrayList, making it more accessible and easier to maintain for future modifications. The use of a sorted ArrayList allowed me to maintain efficient searches while simplifying insertion operations. This balance between performance and ease of use is particularly well-suited for small to medium-sized datasets, which aligns with the requirements of the project. The updated structure also reduced the complexity of the code, making it more understandable for other developers and ensuring it can be easily maintained and extended in the future.
In Module One, I set out to enhance my understanding of algorithm efficiency and the decision-making process involved in selecting appropriate data structures. This artifact enabled me to meet that goal by directly comparing the BST and ArrayList data structures, assessing their trade-offs, and implementing a solution that balances performance and maintainability. Through the enhancement process, I demonstrated my ability to design efficient, maintainable code while also improving my commenting and documentation practices. This focus on clarity and communication ensures that the code can be understood and modified by others.

Reflecting on the process of enhancing and modifying this artifact, I learned valuable lessons about the importance of code readability and maintainability. One challenge I faced was balancing the performance benefits of the BST with the simplicity and flexibility of the ArrayList. I learned that, in some cases, a simpler data structure like the sorted ArrayList can be more appropriate when working with smaller datasets or when ease of future modifications is a priority. Additionally, I refined my understanding of the importance of clear documentation, which is essential not only for myself but also for future developers who may need to work on the code. By focusing on efficient search logic through binary search in the ArrayList, I ensured that the program remained both functional and efficient.

This artifact allowed me to design a computing solution that meets the requirements of Course Outcome #3, demonstrating my ability to apply algorithmic principles and manage design trade-offs effectively.

# [Enhancement #3 Databases](https://github.com/Jeef-K/cs499-Capstone/tree/main/cs499_capstone_databases_enhanced)

The artifact is a Java-based advising program designed to assist students with academic course planning. Initially, the program stored and retrieved course information using an in-memory ArrayList, allowing users to search for courses by their course ID and display all available courses. However, the program has since been enhanced to use an SQLite database for persistent storage of courses and their prerequisites. This update introduces new functionality, such as the ability to import courses from a CSV file and perform CRUD operations on the courses, making the program more scalable and maintainable.
I selected this artifact for my ePortfolio because it demonstrates essential software development skills, particularly in database integration, collaboration, and real world application development. The transition from an ArrayList to an SQLite database highlights my ability to implement scalable, persistent solutions that can handle larger datasets and complex data relationships, such as multiple course prerequisites. Additionally, the inclusion of CSV import functionality and user-friendly database operations showcases my competence in handling external data sources and designing flexible, maintainable software that can be easily adapted to changing requirements.

In alignment with course outcome one, the development of this artifact required strategies for building a collaborative environment by ensuring that the design could be easily understood and modified by other developers. By decoupling the business logic from the data storage layer, I created a modular system that supports collaboration among diverse audiences, enabling more effective decision making in the context of database driven software. The design decisions, such as separating the business logic from database interaction, were made to allow easier collaboration and future extension by developers who may have varying levels of expertise.

Furthermore, the enhancements also addressed course outcome five by emphasizing a security mindset throughout the development process. The move to SQLite not only improved scalability but also allowed me to expose and mitigate potential security vulnerabilities, such as ensuring that user input is properly validated during CSV imports. I implemented input validation and error handling to reduce the risk of SQL injection and maintain data integrity, especially when working with external data sources. This approach helped to ensure the privacy and security of the stored course data, reinforcing the need to anticipate adversarial exploits in the software architecture.

The enhancements to this artifact align with the course outcomes I planned to meet in Module One. By decoupling the application logic from data storage, I successfully developed maintainable and collaborative software that follows best practices in software design. Additionally, the introduction of SQLite as a persistent storage solution ensures secure and efficient data handling, which was a key objective. I adhered to software design principles such as modularity and separation of concerns, where database interaction and business logic are managed independently, supporting a collaborative development environment.

Throughout the process of enhancing and modifying this artifact, I gained valuable insights into database management and integration with Java applications. I learned how to model complex relationships, such as course prerequisites, in a relational database and handle those relationships programmatically. Additionally, I refined my skills in SQL and database design, which proved essential in ensuring the system's scalability, maintainability, and security. One of the primary challenges I faced was designing the database schema to accommodate multiple prerequisites, which required careful consideration of normalization and data relationships. Another challenge was ensuring error handling and validation during CSV file imports and database operations, as it was critical to maintain data integrity, ensure security, and provide clear feedback to users. Overall, the process enhanced my understanding of database-driven applications and reinforced the importance of thoughtful design and security considerations when making improvements to existing software.
